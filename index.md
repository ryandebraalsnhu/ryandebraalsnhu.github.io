A code review is as important to a software developer as a second draft is to an author. Good software is not written in bursts of inspiration but rather honed and perfected over the course of many iterations. 

Code reviews come in a variety of forms including pair programming, over-the-shoulder presentations, and even tool assisted code checks. A typical code review usually consists of one developer reviewing another developer’s code and trying to identify mistakes.

This process has been shown to improve overall code quality in the same way that a proofreader can more easily identify another writer’s mistakes in spelling or grammar because they do not have a personal association with the code.

When someone reviews code they should be looking for common issues such as missed data validation checks or null exceptions, but they should also be conscience of the overall solution that the code is attempting to attain and be thinking about ways on which the process could be improved.

Code reviews should occur frequently throughout the development process. The Agile process is specifically designed to place code reviews at pivotal junctures throughout the SDLC. After a user story is completed and submitted as a pull request, a developer should be made responsible for reviewing the code. This way there is a system of checks in place to make sure that more than one person has signed off on a piece of code and that responsibility for the correct functioning of a piece of code is shared between multiple developers.

Personally, I have found live demonstrations to be the most effective method of code review. It has been my experience that software developers can become very myopic when looking at the code rather than how the code functions from the perspective of the user. No code is bug free, and all code can always be improved in one way or another, but it is important that the developer understands that what they are building is ultimately to satisfy a customer’s needs. So, the first step in developing code is to make it do what the customer wants, the second step should be to retain the quality of the code but still make sure that it does what the customer wants. I have seen numerous occasions when code refactoring has resulted in much cleaner code that no longer performs the basic operations that the “spaghetti code” mysteriously was able to achieve.

For this artifact I chose to consolidate the assignments of Module Three, Five and Six of the CS-260-Q3396 Data Structures and Algorithms course into a single project and allow the user to select which mode they would like to utilize in order to load, read, search and delete bids from a data structure. This was a valuable experience for me because as I revisited each methodology and directly compared them against each other I became much more familiar with the pros and cons of each data structure type.

#### Data Structures
Main.cpp in the FinalProject solution best exemplifies my knowledge and understanding of the data structure types we learned about in this course.

The Linked List mode pulls the data from the CSV and stores it in a data structure with a dynamic size. However, this methodology has several drawbacks:
•	They can only be iterated across in one direction, from the beginning or “head” to the end or “tail”, this means there is no “random access” allowed.
•	A pointer to the head node must be constantly maintained. 

Fig 1. Linked Lists

The Hash Table mode pulls the data into a data structure which utilizes a vector to map a value to a “hash” and then later retrieve that value via its hash. This allows data to be retrieved very quickly. A hash value is often derived using this simple formula: hash = key % noOfBuckets

By being able to simply “lookup” a specific data point in a collection, the ability to retrieve information becomes straightforward. This is a significant improvement over having to iterate across a collection until a match is found.
To avoid collisions,  each “cell” of a hash table is actually a linked list of records so that data can be retrieved from a certain hash index in the same manner as the aforementioned linked list.

The Binary Search Tree mode stores data in a more complex way and is therefore a little more unwieldy but search capabilities are significantly improved because of the way the data is stored and retrieved.

In a Binary Search Tree, each node contains a value from a well-ordered set. Every node in the left subtree contains a value which is smaller than the value in the current node, and every node in the right subtree contains a value which is larger than the value in the current node. This allows for simple boolean logic to quickly search for and retrieve data because the data is being navigated through rather than iterated across.

#### Algorithms

##### Search
All three data structures (linked lists, hash tables and binary search trees) can be adapted to search for and retrieve values contained within them. The Linked List mode is straight forward but limited in its scope, this kind of data storage and retrieval is only really viable for a collection of perhaps a few hundred entries. The Hash Table mode has significant advantages over the linked list method; however, it also inherits the linked lists disadvantages because the chained hash tables still utilize linked lists, and therefore the space overhead of the “next” pointer can be significant. The Binary Search Tree mode does away with the limitations of the linked-list but it also far more complex to work with, it also requires a “well-ordered set”, meaning the performance of the search algorithm is directly related to how well the data being stored is organized.

##### Sort
Sorting of a linked list requires a rather convoluted methodology, because a singly linked list can only be iterated across in one direction, this would require a separate object to be instantiated and maintained in order to capture values that are “above” or “below” the current pointer. (GeeksforGeeks, 2020)
Fig 4. Pseudo Code for sorting a linked list
 
Sorting of a hash table isn’t necessary because as mentioned previously the data structure depends on “hash lookups” rather than iterating across the data.

Sorting of a Binary Search Tree would be antithetical to its very nature. A binary search trees is dependent upon the data being organized by branching logic. 
Hash/Chaining

Hash Chaining is a clever workaround to the limitations of linked lists and the complications of binary search trees. While “under the hood” it seems somewhat clunky in its implementation, ultimately the ability to lookup data values by hash is a worthwhile endeavor that can make an application run faster and easier to develop.
“Search time for hash table lookups are reduced significantly, searching (or inserting / removing) an item may require only O(1), in contrast to O(N) for searching a list or to O(log N) for binary search.” (zyBooks)

##### Effectiveness
Main.cpp in the FinalProject solution was my favorite program to write, because it allowed me to “take off the training wheels” and code something that wasn’t prescribed. I liked creating the “modes” for each data structure type and organizing the different functionalities into discrete methods. I wish I had had more time to make the code mode modular. I ended up sticking all the classes I created into a single .cpp file which made it quite long and harder and harder to maintain as time went on. I didn’t take the time to learn about the relationship between .cpp files and .h files, so “importing” classes was out of the question. I ended up using regions to better organize code, but if I were to continue development on this project I would move the LinkedList, HashTable, and BinarySearchTree classes into individual files.

I think the code is highly reusable, all the data structure implementations can be adapted to another project simply be swapping our the Bid struct for another object that needs to be maintained in a collection.

I am pleased with the annotations I placed in the code base, I try to code based on a motto I heard several years ago: “verbosity over brevity”, To me this means it does not serve anyone better to write code that isn’t cleanly organized and well documented. I think software developers are often tempted to try to condense their code into the smallest amount of space as possible, especially with the advent of LINQ. Coding something that works is the most important, but coding something that can be easily interpreted by another developer is a close second.

##### Conclusion
When building something, either in code or in the real world, it is important to use the right tool for the job. Knowing which kind of data structure to use will save development time and result in cleaner, faster code. In this case, I think the eBid Search application that we created was best organized using the Binary Search Tree data structure because each entry has a gaurenteed BidID, I would modify the BidID to be an integer value rather than a string value because that would allow the BST to more quickly determine which branch (left or right) to go down, I imagine the string manipulation of the unique identifier would eventually have a significant impact on search speed.
I was routinely surprised by the amount of effort put into creating things that I routinely take for granted in my day-to-day work developing applications in C#. Dictionarys, LINQ, NO Pointers. These are just a handful of examples of the kinds of tools that I routinely us and never give a second thought.

### Artifact Two: Client\Server Development
https://github.com/ryandebraalsnhu/ClientServer_PortfolioItem
###### This project is available as a [Repo](https://github.com/ryandebraalsnhu/ClientServer_PortfolioItem).

For this artifact I chose to submit the final project for CS-499-X6397 Computer Science Capstone 21EW6, an application which is used to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) records from a MongoDB database.

## Motivation
Animal Shelter was created to facilitate record keeping for the Austin Animal Control Center (AAC) database.

## Functionality
The application in its current state can be used to navigate the AAC database, filter by various conditions, visualize the GPS location where the animal was found, and generate a breakdown of outcomes per filtered section.

In the future this application can be expanded to create a fully realized CRUD application capable of maintaining the data retained and administrated by the Austin Animal Control Center.

## Tools and rationale
This application was developed to leverage the pre-existing instance of MongoDB, which is a document-based, “No-SQL” database. 

The data access layer (DAL), or Controller in MVC parlance, utilizes PyMongo (https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data. 

The user interface, or View in MVC parlance, is powered by Dash (https://dash.plotly.com/introduction), a framework for building web analytic applications.

These technologies were chosen for their relative ease of use and rapid stand-up time. Each component of this n-tier application was developed modularly so that it could be enhanced or swapped out easily in the future as need dictates. For example, if the client decided that they wanted the application to run on the Django web framework, they could simply reutilize the existing CRUD.py component and write a new user interface.
